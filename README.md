# Protean #

## Description ##

`protean` is a library for representing hierarchical data in a uniform way across multiple platforms.

The library defines a `variant` object that can hold primitive data as well as collections (e.g. lists, dictionaries) with arbitrary depth. The variant can be inspected, enumerated, and/or serialised to XML/binary format.

Protean has implementations in C++, C# and Python.

## Compilation ##

Protean is known to build on:

- Windows with MS Visual Studio 2013, 2015, 2017
- Mac with scons 3.0.1 and LLVM 9.0.0
- RHEL Linux with GCC 4.8.5

On Windows, the following method will work:

- Install [Boost](http://www.boost.org/). (Known to work with 1.55 and 1.66.)
- Install [Xerces](http://xerces.apache.org/). (Known to work with version 3.1.1.)
- Copy _projects/vc1x/vc1x-paths.props.template_ to _projects/vc1x/vc1x-paths.props_. Edit the latter to set `BOOST_VERSION`, `BOOST_ROOT`, and `XERCES_ROOT` appropriately.
- Open _projects/vc1x-protean.sln_ in your chosen version of Visual Studio.
- Choose a configuration, e.g. `vc141 Release` and `x64`, and Build Solution.

## Usage examples ##

### Generating and outputting XML ###

```cpp
using variant = protean::variant;
variant root(variant::Dictionary);
variant books(variant::Dictionary);
variant book(variant::Dictionary);
variant book_attrs(variant::Dictionary);
book_attrs.insert("author", variant("XYZ"));
book_attrs.insert("year", variant(2013));
book.insert(protean::xml_attributes, book_attrs);
book.insert(protean::xml_text, variant("some text"));
books.insert("book", book);
root.insert("books", books);
std::stringstream contents;
protean::xml_writer writer(contents, xml_mode::Preserve | xml_mode::Indent);
writer << root;
std::cout << contents.str() << std::endl;
```

This will output:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<books>
  <book author="XYZ" year="2013">some text</book>
</books>
```
